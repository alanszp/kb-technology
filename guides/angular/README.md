## Development

We use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), kind of an MVC framework with tools like components, two way data binding, dependency injection and a great community, [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) to handle dependencies and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for building tasks like compiling less, minifying assets, etc.

### Angular modules

* **ui-router:** Best routing framework for AngularJS.
* **angularFire:** Integrate Angular with Firebase.
* **restangular:** Consume REST Apis con Angular.

Browse http://ngmodules.org/ for angular modules.

### Utilities

* **lodash:** Utility methods for doing map, filter and a bunch of others things.

## Testing

  We use [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) for testing and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) as test runner, karma loads your scripts and test scripts into the selected browser and reports the results. 
  
  We're using protractor for integration test, check out our guide [here](https://github.com/zauberlabs/kb-technology/blob/master/guides/protractor.md)
