## Development

We use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), kind of an MVC framework with tools like components, two way data binding, dependency injection and a great community, [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) to handle dependencies and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for building tasks like compiling less, minifying assets, etc.

* **angularFire:** Integrate Angular with Firebase.
* **Restangular:** Consume REST Apis con Angular.
